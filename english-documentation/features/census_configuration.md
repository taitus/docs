# Configure Census Connection

The objective of this service is to be able to configure the connection with the Town Hall Census through the Administration panel without having to modify the application code.

It should be noted that to properly configure this connection will require a technical profile that knows the WebService of your City Council.

Currently the application was designed to send only the **document number** and **document type**. With this new feature is enabled the possibility of sending if necessary the fields **date of birth** and **postal code**.

## Activate feature

In the section **Configuration &gt; Global Configuration** a new tab **Remote Census Configuration** has been added.

If we have the feature deactivated we will see an informative text that will indicate us how to activate it: ![Feature disabled](../../.gitbook/assets/feature-disabled-en%20%281%29.png)

To activate the feature you must perform 2 steps: 1. Execute the following command `bin/rake settings:create_remote_census_setting RAILS_ENV=production` 1. Access through the administration panel of your application to the section **Settings &gt; Features** and activate the module **Configure connection to the remote census \(SOAP\)** as shown below: ![Feature enabled](../../.gitbook/assets/feature-enabled-en%20%281%29.png)

## Configuration

Once the feature is activated, we can access the section **Settings &gt; Global Settings** and click on the tab **Remote Census Configuration**. In this screen you will be able to fill in all the necessary information to be able to configure the connection with the Census of each Town Hall.

The information to be filled in is divided into three sections:

1. **General Information**
   * **Endpoint**: Host name where the census service is available \(wsdl\).

     ![General information - Endpoint](../../.gitbook/assets/general-information-endpoint-en.png)
2. **Request Data**

   In this section we will fill in all the necessary fields to be able to make a request to verify a user through the Census of the City council.

   ![Request Data](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-en%20%281%29.png)

   To help you understand how to fill in each of the fields, we will rely on a supposed WebService that receives a method called `:get_habita_datos` with the following structure:

   ```text
   {
    request: {
      codigo_institucion: 12,        # Static Value
      codigo_portal:      5,         # Static Value
      codigo_usuario:     10,        # Static Value
      documento:          12345678Z, # Dynamic value related to Document Number
      tipo_documento:     1,         # Dynamic value related to Document Type
      nivel:              3          # Static Value
    }
   }
   ```

   Required fields for the request:

   * **Request method name**: Request method name accepted by the City Census WebService.

     Example: ![Request Data - Method name](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-method-name-en.png)

   * **Request Structure**: Structure of the request received by the WebService of the Census of the City Council. The "static" values of this request should be reported. The "dynamic" values related to Document Type, Document Number, Date of Birth and Postal Code should be filled with null value.

     Example: ![Request Data - Structure](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-structure-en.png) ![Request Data - Structure](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-structure-info-en%20%281%29.png)

   * **Path for document type**: Path in the request structure that sends the Document Type.

     _NOTE: DO NOT FILL IN if the WebService does not require the Document Type to verify a user._

     Example: ![Request Data - Path document type](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-path-document-type-en.png)

   * **Path for document number**: Path in the request structure that sends the Document Number.

     _NOTE: DO NOT FILL IN if the WebService does not require the Document Number to verify a user._

     Example: ![Request Data - Path document number](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-path-document-number-en.png)

   * **Path for date of birth**: Path in the request structure that sends the Date of Birth.

     _NOTE: DO NOT FILL IN if the WebService does not require the Date of Birth to verify a user._

     In the case of _Example_ we will fill it in blank, since it is not necessary to send the date of birth to verify a user.

     Example: ![Request Data - Path date of birth](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-path-date-of-birth-en.png)

   * **Path for Postal Code**: Path in the request structure that sends the Postal Code.

     _NOTE: DO NOT FILL IN if the WebService does not require the Postal Code to verify a user._

     En el caso del _Example_ lo dejaríamos en blanco, ya que no se necesita enviar el código postal para verificar a un usuario.

     Example: ![Request Data - Path postal code](../../.gitbook/assets/request-data-path-postal-code-en%20%281%29.png)

3. **Response data**

   In this section we will configure all the necessary fields to be able to receive the answer of the WebService and to verify a user in the application.

   ![Response Data](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-en%20%281%29.png)

   As in the previous section we will define an example answer, to help you understand how to fill in each of the fields in this section.

   ```text
      {
        get_habita_datos_response: {
          get_habita_datos_return: {
            datos_habitante: {
              item: {
                fecha_nacimiento_string: "31-12-1980",
                identificador_documento: "12345678Z",
                descripcion_sexo: "Varón",
                nombre: "José",
                apellido1: "García"
              }
            },
            datos_vivienda: {
              item: {
                codigo_postal: "28013",
                codigo_distrito: "01"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
   ```

   Required fields to parse the response:

   * **Path for Date of Birth**: In what path of the response is the user's Date of Birth?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path date of birth](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-date-of-birth-en.png)

   * **Path for Postal Code**: In what path of the response is the user's Postal Code?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path postal code](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-postal-code-en.png)

   * **Path for District**: In what path of the response is the user's District?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path district](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-district-en%20%281%29.png)

   * **Path for Gender**: In what path of response is the user's Gender?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path Gender](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-gender-en%20%281%29.png)

   * **Path for Name**: In what path of the response is the user's Name?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path Name](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-name-en%20%281%29.png)

   * **Path for the Last Name**: In what path of the response is the user's Last Name?.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path Last Name](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-last-name-en%20%281%29.png)

   * **Condition for detecting a valid response**: What response path has to come informed to be considered a valid response and user verified.

     Example: ![Response Data - Path valid response](../../.gitbook/assets/response-data-path-valid-response-en.png)

Once the general data, the necessary fields of the request and "all" fields to validate the response have been filled in correctly, the application will be able to verify any user through the defined WebService.
