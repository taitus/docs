# Installation

These are our recommendations for the different environments and purposes:

* To setup CONSUL for a production environment we recommend using the [installer](https://github.com/consul/installer).
* For developers working on a CONSUL fork we recommend using a UNIX based system \(Linux or Mac\) and installing CONSUL [locally system wide](local_installation/).
* If you run into problems configuring CONSUL locally system wide and would like to show CONSUL for demo purposes we recommend using [Docker](servers/docker.md) in a local machine.
* We also have a [Heroku guide](servers/deploying-on-heroku.md) which can be used for demo purposes in a remote server.
