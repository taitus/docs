# Introduction

These are our recommendations for the different environments and purposes:

- To setup CONSUL for a production environment we recommend using the [installer](https://github.com/consul/installer).

- For developers working on a CONSUL fork we recommend using a UNIX based system (Linux or Mac) and installing CONSUL [locally system wide](local_installation.md).

- If you run into problems configuring CONSUL locally system wide and would like to show CONSUL for demo purposes we recommend using [Docker](docker.md) in a local machine.

- We also have a [Heroku guide](deploying-on-heroku.md) which can be used for demo purposes in a remote server.
